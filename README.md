# **Calculator**
Create a Calculator App using Tkinter in Python


## Requirements:
1. Python IDE (Recommended Anaconda with Python 3.6 or higher)
2. Tkinter module

## Project discription:

This project is a simple yet efficient GUI-based Calculator developed using Python and the **_tkinter_** library. The application features a clean and intuitive interface, providing basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

Key components include buttons for digits and operators, a display screen to show input/output, and an entry field to handle dynamic calculations. Functions are implemented to capture user input, perform real-time evaluations, and handle errors gracefully.

This project highlights the use of widgets like buttons, labels, and frames, demonstrating event handling, layout management, and user interaction within a GUI application.
